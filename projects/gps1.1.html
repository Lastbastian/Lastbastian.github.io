        <h3>Why Pairing?</h3>
            <p>Pairing is a collaborative process between DBC'ers where two individuals
            of varying strengths are able to work together to accomplish a common goal.</p>
            <p>Programmers are able to support each other by sharing knowledge and debugging together.</p>
        <h3>How to pair</h3>
            <p>Usually there will be one person driving and the other will be navigating.<br />
                The driver is the person who actually works at the keyboard.<br />
                The navigator guides the driver and has the big picture view of the project.
