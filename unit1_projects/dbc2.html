  		<p>This website is dedicated to the early drum machnes and synthesizers that started hip hop and electronic dance music.  Many of these machines were able to be found used or on the cheap.  Thus allowing music pioneers a cheap way in to start experimenting and incoporating beats or rhythms into disco based sounds of the late 1970s.</p>
