  		<p><a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/" />CSS Zen Garden</a><br>I mainly like this site becuase it gives me some inspiration about what CSS can end up doing.  Visitors on the site are encouraged to click links that load different CSS style sheets just to see what different disigns look like.  The HTML code is all the same.<p>
  		<p>My eye is drawn to the unity of the entire page.  Each CSS style sheet produces an entirely new look and feel, but overall the designs are well integrated and creative.  I would describe this site as elegant, integrated, serene, and simple.</p>
  		<p>From a content perspective, the site is designed to show what can be accomplished with advanced CSS techniques.  The content is focused, broad, and inspirational.  This is similar in feeling to how I described the overall design.  Furthering the feel of unity.</p>
  		<p>Navigation is very simple on the site. The content is delivered simply and it is all easy to get at.  After being on this site I feel inspired to create some great CSS designs!</p>
