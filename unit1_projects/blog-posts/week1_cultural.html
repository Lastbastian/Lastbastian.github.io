      <p>Based on the video, what's your take on the DBC experience? What is your impression of DBC? How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture? Have your expectations of DBC changed? If so, how? Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</p><br /><br />
      <p>This whole process is really exciting to me.  There is something extraordinary about being able to push my own experience.  It seems like a chance to be responsible for my own learning experience.</p>
      <p>I excited to see how it plays out in our cohort classrooms.  I know when I take classes there is a part of me that is comfortable letting the teacher control the learning process.  In the scenario I am just there to receive.  What is being presented to me at Dev Bootcamp is an opportunity to engage my whole self in the learning process - not just recieving, but actively engaging, offering, and, questioning.</p>
      <p>I don't think my expectations have changed.  I knew, from a good friend of mine, what I was getting into before hand.  Even so - if anything, I think I feel a little more nervous...</p><br /><br />
      <p>Talk about what came up for you and anything you want in addition to the questions above.</p><br><br>
      <p>I have both of those fears coming up for me.  Well, one a little more than the other, but that being said there is a bigger part of me that is really excited to engage in this process.</p>
      <p>I am excited there will be a yoga/meditation practice to balance out the intensive techy time.  I think that is all for now.</p>
