        <h4>Week 6 - Stereo Type Threat</h4>
        <p>In your post, describe your experiences with stereotype threat and how it affected you. Then identify what you plan to do when you feel stereotype threat or suspect someone else is feeling it. How will you create meaningful feedback or ask for feedback? How will you work to change the environment you're in to make it more welcoming? How will you address it in public?</p>
        <h4>Week 5 - Pairing and Feedback</h4>
        <p>Pairing is an integral part of DBC. That's not to say that it doesn't have challenges and pitfalls, but to me it seems like it's part of the learning process here at DBC. From my own experiences there have been times when the pairing session have been very helpful both individually and as a member of the group. Overall, I have found my pairs to be very easy to work with and sharing of what they know.</p>
        <p>It has been rewarding to come to a challenge we both we unsure of how to handle and see how we eventually move through it. Sometimes we may have needed a break for a 1/2 hour other times it was just trying different things, but we eventually were able to push through. I have had a sesion or two where we were both able to come up with our own solution, but we then took time to refactor each others code and share our insights into how we were working together.</p>
        <p>I have also had challenging pairing sessions. Ones where I or my parter wasn't grasping the material and it was really hard to move forward with the challenge. Somtimes we were able to flounder through the challenge or one or the other of us took the helm to head the challenge. I have to say, from my perspective, it is really frustrating when it has been me that isn't up to par on the material.</p>
        <p>The feedback has been helpful for the most part.  Although, I dread getting feedback from someone when I know I wasn't up to par with the challenge even that feedback has been positive and even motivational. I enjoy giving feedback as well. Initially, it was a challenge to come up with a constructive comment, but through experience that has become easier for me as well.</p>
        <h4>Week 4 - Tech Problems - Net Neutrality</h4>
        <p>This is a large topic and one that I will only likely be able to decant here a little. From <a href="http://www.publicknowledge.org">publicknowledge.org</a> - <em>Net Neutrality is defined as the principle that Internet service providers and governments should treat all data on the Internet equally, not discriminating or charging differentially by user, content, site, platform, application, type of attached equipment, and modes of communication.</em></p>
        <p>Net Neutrality is an essential part of what is called the <strong>Open Internet</strong>. The Open Internet is a place where policy and open web standards allow the free flow of information and business without interference by a third party.From the Net Neutrality article on <a href="http://http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_neutrality">wikipedia.org</a>: An Open Internet means full resources of the Internet and means to operate on it are easily accessible to all individuals and companies</p>
        <p>A <strong>Closed Internet</strong> is just the opposite, in that it favors certian types of data or usage.</p>
        <p>The resulting fear from a Closed Internet system is that ISPs (Internet Service Providers) could set up a tiered system thus favoring certain types of traffic and not others or charge fees base on types of use. Imagine web traffic being able to reach one site (because it is large and able to pay) vs. a competing site (which is smaller and unable to pay).</p>
        <h4>Potential solutions to the issue of Net Neutrality</h4>
        <p>The idea of Internet service being labeled as a <em>Common Carrier</em>framework.  The common carrier framework is also used in the United States for public utilities (electricity, water, etc.), and public transportation. Common carriers are prohibited from interfering with service based on the customer or nature of goods.</p>

        <h4>Week 3 - Thinking Style</h4>
        <p>According to the test I have a mind-style of <em>Concrete Random</em> with a close second being <em>Abstract Random</em>.  Some of the aspects of the <em>Concrete Random</em> that ring true to me are:</p>
        <p>They learn best when...</p>
        <ul>
          <li>in a personalized environment</li>
          <li>given broad or general guidelines</li>
          <li>able to maintain friendly relationships</li>
          <li>able to participate in group activities</li>
        </ul>
        <p>What rings true of the <em>Abstract Random</em>?
        <ul>
          <li>experimenting to find answers</li>
          <li>taking risks</li>
          <li>use their intuition</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This is pretty enlightening for me. It gives me a strong insight into how I actually process information and what does and DOESN'T work for me. It's very validating to see what doesn't work for me as well.<p>
        <p>The hardest part for me so far has been the reading campaigns - specifically the Elouquent Java page(s). With out a specific reference for the material the reading just passes me by.  Like two boats passing at night. I have discovered that if I read for 15 minutes and then do something else I can eventually get through the material. Usually, I really enjoy reading.  I just don't initially digest complicated material that way.  For me if I can get my hands on something and play with it for a while or have someone walk me through it, I then like to return to a manual or reference material and "fill-in-the-blanks".</p>
        <h4>Week 2 - Fears and DBC</h4>
        <p>Question - What scares you the most about being at DBC?</p>
        <p>I quit a job that I had been at for 5 years.  I had been feeling unchallenged and unfulfilled for quite a while so I decided to rock my boat and enroll in DBC! Now I am a little worried about the commitment I just made.  What if I am not really into coding after this?</p>
        <p>Some of these make me laugh a little when I release them out into the internetosphere.  One really big thing that I can identify about all of this is that I am really, really excited to be doing this.  I am going to acknowledge that I have the fears, but choose to follow my excitement</p>
        <p>Anyway, I think if I had a friend who shared these same fears I would take some time to just listen to them talk about whats up.</p>
        <h4>Week 1 - Chefs Kitchen</h4>
        <p>Questions - Based on the video, what's your take on the DBC experience? What is your impression of DBC? How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture? Have your expectations of DBC changed? If so, how? Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</p>
        <p>Talk about what came up for you and anything you want in addition to the questions above.</p>
        <h5>answers below:</h5>
        <p>The DBC experience seems right up my alley.  It is the best way for me to learn.  That is to say; I like getting into things right away.  I like playing and experimenting with code to see what it does and being a chef in the kitchen may be more challenging, but probably more rewarding as well.</p>
        <p>There is a hugh opportunity for collaboration here. It seems like a bunch of mad scientists working together. While I may be more knowledgeable in some areas, others will be in others and this can really work to our advantage when we work together. There is a whole lot of creativity in this sort of supportive community.</p>
        <p>I think I can engage in this culture pretty well. For me, I think, I will have to become more comfortable with making mistakes in front of others.  A mistake can be a big learning opportunity when approached in the right way. No doubt DBC will be an adjustment from other classes I have been enrolled in, but the courses seem so experiential - I get to create my own learning experience!</p>
        <p>This does make me nervous, but I think that is good.  It means things are working, moving, and excitable!</p>
