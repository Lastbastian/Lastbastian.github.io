        <h4>Week 2 - </h4>
        <h4>Week 1 - Chefs Kitchen</h4>
        <p>Questions - Based on the video, what's your take on the DBC experience? What is your impression of DBC? How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture? Have your expectations of DBC changed? If so, how? Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</p>
        <p>Talk about what came up for you and anything you want in addition to the questions above.</p>
        <h5>answers below:</h5>
        <p>The DBC experience seems right up my alley.  It is the best way for me to learn.  That is to say; I like getting into things right away.  I like playing and experimenting with code to see what it does and being a chef in the kitchen may be more challenging, but probably more rewarding as well.</p>
        <p>There is a hugh opportunity for collaboration here. It seems like a bunch of mad scientists working together. While I may be more knowledgeable in some areas, others will be in others and this can really work to our advantage when we work together. There is a whole lot of creativity in this sort of supportive community.</p>
        <p>I think I can engage in this culture pretty well. For me, I think, I will have to become more comfortable with making mistakes in front of others.  A mistake can be a big learning opportunity when approached in the right way. No doubt DBC will be an adjustment from other classes I have been enrolled in, but the courses seem so experiential - I get to create my own learning experience!</p>
        <p>This does make me nervous, but I think that is good.  It means things are working, moving, and excitable!</p>
